## Conforama Email Scraping - CONTINUE TOMORROW

**Task:** Complete Conforama seller email scraping until ALL Google pages are processed.

**Status:**
- ✅ French site (conforama.fr): 19 emails found from search snippets
- ❌ Direct page scraping blocked by 403 errors (anti-bot protection)
- ⏳ Only scraped 5 pages initially, then 20 pages in expanded run
- 📁 Failed URLs analysis saved: `conforama-failed-urls-403.txt`

**Tomorrow's Plan:**
1. Continue scraping Conforama.fr until all Google result pages are exhausted
2. Try Puppeteer/Playwright browser automation to bypass 403 errors
3. Or expand serper.dev snippet extraction approach (it works!)
4. Then move to Conforama.es for Spanish seller emails
5. Goal: Complete coverage of all available seller emails

**Files Created:**
- `conforama_scraper_v2.py` - Scraper with rate limiting
- `conforama-fr-emails.csv` - 19 French seller emails
- `conforama-fr-full-emails.csv` - Expanded run results
- `conforama-es-emails.csv` - Spanish site (empty)
- `CONFORAMA_SCRAPER_SUMMARY.md` - Complete report
- `conforama-failed-urls-403.txt` - Failed URLs with retry strategy
