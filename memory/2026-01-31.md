## PARA Memory System Implementation

### ✅ Completed
- Implemented three-layer memory system (knowledge graph, daily notes, tacit knowledge)
- Created PARA directory structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Built atomic facts database (12 facts extracted from existing notes)
- Developed retrieval system with tiered access (T1: 8 facts, T2: 4 facts, T3: 0 facts)
- Created heartbeat script for automated memory extraction
- Integrated system into AGENTS.md workflow

### Architecture
- **Knowledge Graph:** `knowledge/facts.json` (queryable JSON with metadata)
- **Daily Notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (episodic memory)
- **Tacit Knowledge:** `MEMORY.md` (curated wisdom)
- **PARA Structure:** Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives

### Key Features
- Memory decay algorithm (recency + frequency-based)
- Tiered retrieval (context window fills T1 → T2 → T3)
- Atomic facts with entities, tags, importance scores
- Automatic access tracking (counter + timestamp)
- Heartbeat automation (extract facts, update scores, archive)

### Facts Extracted (12 total)
- Transcription app project (completed 2026-01-29)
- API keys configured (AssemblyAI, OpenRouter, z.ai, Perplexity)
- Deployment preferences (always Vercel)
- Workflow patterns (user creates accounts, AI handles setup)
- Spotify DRM limitations and automation
- AI development area (ongoing)

### Documentation Created
- `memory/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` - Full architecture
- `knowledge/README.md` - Quick reference
- `memory/2026-01-31-para-memory-implementation.md` - Implementation summary

## Token Usage

- **Current session:** ~9,012 tokens (8.6k in / 412 out)
- **5-hour window:** 98% remaining (~4h 55m)
- **Monthly:** 100% remaining

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up cron job for heartbeat automation (2-4x/day)
- [ ] Extract facts from remaining daily notes (2026-01-27, 2026-01-28)
- [ ] Test fact extraction with AI during heartbeat
- [ ] Add more PARA project/area folders as needed

*Memory system is operational and ready for long-term use.*
