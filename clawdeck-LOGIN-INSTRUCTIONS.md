# 🚀 Permanent Tunnel Setup - In Progress

## Step 1: Login to Cloudflare

A browser window should have opened, or visit:

**https://dash.cloudflare.com/argotunnel?aud=&callback=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.cloudflareaccess.org%2FpcT0NsI0P4oCcMHWQqNk_sGydpFAi_BHRfxBaNxcQi0%3D**

### What to Do:

1. **If you have a Cloudflare account:**
   - Login with your email/password
   - Select the domain you want to use
   - Click "Authorize"

2. **If you don't have an account:**
   - Click "Create account"
   - Use your email
   - Add a domain (see options below)
   - Complete the authorization

### Domain Options

**Option A: Use a domain you own**
- Any domain you already have
- It must be added to your Cloudflare account

**Option B: Get a free subdomain**
- DuckDNS: https://www.duckdns.org (recommended)
  - Create something like: `yourname.duckdns.org`
  - Completely free, no limits
- No-IP: https://www.noip.com
  - Create something like: `yourname.ddns.net`
  - Free with email confirmation every 30 days

### After Authorizing

Once you complete the authorization in the browser, the terminal command will finish automatically.

**Then tell me:**
- What domain/subdomain you want to use
- I'll configure everything else automatically

**Waiting for you to complete authorization in browser...**
