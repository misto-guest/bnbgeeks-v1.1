# Areas

*Ongoing responsibilities and spheres of activity*

## What goes here
- Areas of your life/work that require continuous attention
- No specific deadline or completion criteria
- Examples: "Health", "Finances", "Professional Development", "Relationships"

## Structure
Create a folder per area:
```
Areas/
├── area-name/
│   ├── README.md          # Area overview and goals
│   ├── notes.md           # Ongoing observations
│   └── resources/         # Reference materials
```

## Difference from Projects
- **Areas** have no completion date (maintain ongoing)
- **Projects** have clear goals and end dates
- Example: "Fitness" is an Area, "Marathon Training" is a Project
