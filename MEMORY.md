# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

*This is your curated long-term memory. Write things here that you want to remember across sessions — important events, decisions, lessons learned, preferences.*

## Sections

### Important Events
*(Keep a log of significant events worth remembering)*

### Decisions
*(Key decisions made, why, and their impact)*

### Preferences
*(What the user likes/dislikes, how they prefer to work)*

### Lessons Learned
*(Mistakes made and what they taught you)*

### People
*(Important people the user works with, their roles, how to interact with them)*

---

*Keep this organized. Use headings to separate topics. Delete or archive old info that's no longer relevant.*
