## 💡 Tips for Authentic Storytelling

**Be Specific Instead of:**
- "I invested in Dubai and learned a lot"

**Say:**
- "In 2019 kocht ik een appartement in JVC voor €80,000. Beloofde 20% ROI. Uiteindelijk 18 maanden vertraging."

**Be Vulnerable**
Admitting mistakes builds trust. Share:
- What you lost
- What you'd do differently
- What embarrassed you

**Be Honest About Motivations**
- "Ik wil anderen helpen dezelfde fouten te vermijden"
- "Er was te veel misleading info"
- "Ik wou dat ik dit had gehad toen ik begon"
