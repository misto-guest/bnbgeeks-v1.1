## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Story, Not Features
Your story is what makes you unique.
Features support the story.

### Tip 2: Be Specific
"I made €50k" > "I made good money"
"In 2019" > "A few years ago"
"€45,000 loss" > "Significant loss"

### Tip 3: Include Failure
Perfection isn't relatable.
Struggle is.

### Tip 4: Use Real Photo
Stock photos = faceless brand
Your photo = trust

### Tip 5: Add Guarantee
Most don't do this.
You'll stand out.
